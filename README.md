# Ionic Intune Demo - React

This is a demo (written React) that demonstrates how to use Ionic's Intune integration to add Microsoft Intune policy protection and broker-based authentication to obtain access tokens to Microsoft services.

See [ionic-team/demo-intune-angular](https://github.com/ionic-team/demo-intune-angular) for a demo using Angular (Capacitor only).

## Capacitor and Cordova

This demo has Capacitor and Cordova examples. We _strongly_ recommend teams build with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/).

To see the Cordova demo, access the `cordova` branch.
